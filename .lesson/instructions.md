## Task Modify
This code requires some small modifications to get it to print properly. It also has a bug that will cause it to crash. If you forget how to fix these sorts of crashes, look back at the changes you made in lesson 3.8. 

You will need to use the sep= command, and the format function in order to get the correct output.

This code has a self test. Once you think you have the code working, click on the checkmark over on the left

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`
